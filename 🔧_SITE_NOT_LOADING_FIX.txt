  SITE NOT LOADING - TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

COMMON REASONS & FIXES:
========================================

1. DEPLOYMENT STILL IN PROGRESS
----------------------------------------
✓ First deployment takes 10-15 minutes
✓ Check Render dashboard status
✓ Wait for "Live" green status

How to check:
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
- Click on "gyanbazaar" service
- Look at status (top right)
- If "Building" or "Deploying" → Wait
- If "Live" → Continue to next step

2. DOCKER BUILD FAILED
----------------------------------------
Check the logs for errors:

Go to Render dashboard → gyanbazaar → Logs

Common errors:

Error: "Port binding failed"
Fix: Check Dockerfile uses $PORT variable

Error: "Composer install failed"
Fix: Check composer.json is valid

Error: "Database connection failed"
Fix: Database might not be ready yet

3. PHP SERVER NOT STARTING
----------------------------------------
The Dockerfile might have issues.

Let me check and fix it...

4. DATABASE NOT READY
----------------------------------------
The database takes 5-10 minutes to provision.

Check:
- Go to Render dashboard
- Click "gyanbazaar-db"
- Status should be "Available"
- If "Creating" → Wait

5. WRONG PORT CONFIGURATION
----------------------------------------
Render uses dynamic ports.

The Dockerfile must use: ${PORT:-10000}

========================================
  QUICK FIX: CHECK LOGS
========================================

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click "gyanbazaar" service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for errors

Common log messages:

✓ "Build successful" → Good!
✓ "Starting service" → Good!
✓ "Listening on port" → Good!
✗ "Error" or "Failed" → Problem!

Copy the error message and I'll help fix it.

========================================
  MANUAL REDEPLOY
========================================

If stuck, force a redeploy:

1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "gyanbazaar"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" button
4. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
5. Wait 10-15 minutes

========================================
  CHECK IF SITE IS ACTUALLY RUNNING
========================================

Even if loading slowly, check:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try loading the site
4. Check response:
   - 200 OK → Site working, just slow
   - 502 Bad Gateway → Service not started
   - 503 Service Unavailable → Still deploying
   - Timeout → Port issue

========================================
  ALTERNATIVE: USE RAILWAY INSTEAD
========================================

If Render keeps failing, try Railway:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose: sfddb248-lab/gyanbazaar
5. Add MySQL database
6. Deploy

Railway is often faster and more reliable.

========================================
  WHAT TO SEND ME FOR HELP
========================================

To help you fix this, send me:

1. Current status (Building/Deploying/Live/Failed)
2. Last 20 lines from Logs tab
3. Any error messages you see
4. Screenshot of Render dashboard

I'll fix it immediately!

========================================
  MOST LIKELY ISSUE
========================================

If this is your first deployment:
→ Just wait 10-15 minutes
→ Render free tier is slow on first deploy
→ Check back in 10 minutes

If deployment shows "Live" but site won't load:
→ Check logs for PHP errors
→ Database might not be connected
→ Port configuration issue
